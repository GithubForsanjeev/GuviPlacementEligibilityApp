## üß© Problem Statement

Design and implement a Streamlit application where users can input **eligibility criteria** for placements (e.g., minimum problem-solving scores or soft skills scores). Based on these inputs, the app filters and displays the eligible students from a dataset stored in a relational database.

---

## üíº Business Use Cases

- üéì **Placement Management**: Shortlist students dynamically using filters.
- üìà **Student Performance Tracking**: Assess placement readiness using skill metrics.
- üìä **Interactive Analytics**: Deliver actionable insights to placement teams via visual dashboards.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python (OOP principles)
- **Database**: SQLite / MySQL
- **Libraries**: Faker, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Streamlit
- **Other Tools**: Git, VSCode, Jupyter

## üöÄ Approach

### Step 1: Dataset Creation
Generate four interlinked tables using **Faker**:
1. **Students Table**: Name, age, gender, city, contact, enrollment and graduation year.
2. **Programming Table**: Language, problems solved, assessments, mini projects, certifications, project scores.
3. **Soft Skills Table**: Scores for communication, teamwork, presentation, leadership, etc.
4. **Placements Table**: Placement status, internship count, interview rounds, company, package, date.

### Step 2: Data Storage
- Store the data in **SQLite** or **MySQL**.
- Use **Python classes** for database operations and relationships.

### Step 3: Streamlit Application
- Accept dynamic input criteria from users (e.g., `problems_solved > 50`, `communication > 75`)
- Show a filtered list of **eligible students**.
- Add download option for filtered results.

### Step 4: SQL Queries & Insights
Write and display **10 insightful queries**, such as:
- Average programming performance by batch
- Top 5 placement-ready students
- Soft skills score distribution
- Certification vs mock interview correlation

## üìä Sample SQL Insights

```sql
-- 1. Top 5 Students Ready for Placement
SELECT s.name, pl.mock_interview_score
FROM Students s
JOIN Placements pl ON s.student_id = pl.student_id
WHERE pl.placement_status = 'Ready'
ORDER BY pl.mock_interview_score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

(Include 10 such queries in a separate SQL file.)
